# Bill-System
I developed this C++ menudriven program in my 12th. Pass code is tanmay22. Here the user's personal data and no. of units of electricity consumed will be entered in the program. And then corresponding bill of the user can be obtained. Here, all the data gets saved so data can be viewed even after program closes and the data can be modified/deleted/viewed etc according to the requirement.
